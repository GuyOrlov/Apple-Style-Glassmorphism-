# 📊 Power BI Sidebar Dashboard

A modern, interactive **Apple-style sidebar dashboard** built entirely with **Power BI DAX, HTML, and CSS** — no JavaScript needed.

---

## 🗂️ What this is

This template lets you build:

✅ A **collapsible sidebar** with:
- Inline Apple logo SVG
- SVG icons for Home, Explore, Analytics, and Projects
- Your profile photo icon as a proper menu item at the bottom

✅ Clean **glassmorphism cards** to display key data:
- Completed Reports
- Pending Analysis
- Active Datasets

✅ 100% pure DAX — works inside any **HTML Viewer** or **HTML Content** visual in Power BI.

---

## ✨ Why it’s special

- Inspired by Apple UI and CodePen glassmorphism.
- Fully dynamic — link your own DAX measures for stats.
- Profile icon works perfectly in both collapsed & expanded modes.
- Clean, responsive layout — works on desktop and mobile.

---

## ⚙️ How it works

### 1️⃣ Sidebar

- Uses `flexbox` and a hover effect to expand.
- SVG icons stay crisp at any size.
- Profile picture is a circular icon — expands name on hover.

### 2️⃣ Data Cards

- Each card block uses your DAX measures.
- Modern blurred background, hover animations.

### 3️⃣ DAX HTML Measure

- Entire HTML, CSS, and SVG icons in one measure.
- Easy to maintain — no external scripts.

## 🚀 How to use

✅ **Step 1:** Create your DAX measures for `Completed Reports`, `Pending Analysis`, `Active Datasets`.

✅ **Step 2:** Copy the full Sidebar Dashboard DAX block into a measure (e.g. `SidebarDashboardHTML`).

✅ **Step 3:** Add an **HTML Content Viewer** or **HTML Viewer** visual to your report canvas.

✅ **Step 4:** Bind your measure output to render the sidebar and cards.

✅ **Step 5:** Connect any slicers, interactions, or dynamic data.
